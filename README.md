# 🧾 Legal Document Generation

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and language models to automate the generation of legal documents based on user input or predefined templates.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook `legal-document-generation.ipynb` provides a step-by-step implementation for:

- Preprocessing legal text  
- Using a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT, T5, or similar)  
- Generating structured legal documents (e.g., NDAs, contracts, agreements)  
- Post-processing and formatting outputs  

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic input prompts for generating custom legal documents  
- Support for common clauses like confidentiality, indemnity, and dispute resolution  
- Template-based and model-based generation options  
- Output exportable as `.txt` or `.pdf` formats  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Hugging Face Transformers / OpenAI API (if applicable)  
- Pandas, NLTK / spaCy (for preprocessing)  
- FPDF / PyPDF2 / ReportLab (for PDF export)
